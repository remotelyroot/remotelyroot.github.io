Cybercriminals are getting sneaky — like, *social engineering meets sleight-of-hand* sneaky. Enter the **ClickFix attack**, a clipboard hijack that leverages JavaScript, PowerShell, and a little human psychology to deliver full-blown malware.

This attack is making the rounds **right now**, and if your users have ever pasted anything into the Run prompt without thinking… you’re already at risk.

---

### 🧠 What Is the ClickFix Attack?

At its core, this is a **JavaScript-to-PowerShell clipboard injection scam** — where attackers trick the user into unknowingly running malicious code on their own system.

---

### 🧪 How the Attack Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Initial Hook**  
   Victim clicks on a malicious ad, fake CAPTCHA page, or phishing email link — landing on a **fake browser warning** (e.g., “Chrome needs repair” or “Fix loading issue”).

2. **Clipboard Hijack via JavaScript**  
   The webpage silently copies a preloaded **PowerShell command** to the user's clipboard using the JavaScript Clipboard API.

3. **Social Engineering Prompt**  
   The victim sees a helpful-looking popup:  
   > “To resolve this issue, press `Windows + R`, paste the following, and press Enter.”

4. **User Executes Malware**  
   Without realizing it, they paste a **PowerShell payload** into the Run dialog that downloads and executes malware.

---

### 🎯 Why It's So Effective

- ✅ **No file downloads or email attachments**  
- ✅ **Bypasses traditional AV** because *you* run the command  
- ✅ **Exploits user trust** and reflexes (“just follow the instructions”)  
- ✅ **Silent** — clipboard API actions don’t show any UI indicators

---

### 💣 Common Payloads Observed

- 🐍 **Lumma Stealer** – steals browser cookies, autofill data, crypto wallets  
- 💼 **NetSupport RAT** – remote access trojan disguised as legitimate software  
- 🧠 **DarkGate** – loader capable of persistence, evasion, and further payloads  
- 🧬 **AsyncRAT** – gives full remote control and surveillance capability  
- 🎯 **Havoc C2 Beacon** – post-exploitation tool used by APTs

---

### 🚨 Real-World Targets

ClickFix is actively being used against:
- Healthcare & insurance providers  
- Law firms & accounting offices  
- Manufacturing and logistics  
- Government contractors  
- *Remote workers using unmanaged devices*

---

### 🔐 How to Defend Against ClickFix Attacks

#### 🛡️ 1. Lock Down PowerShell
- Use **AppLocker**, **WDAC**, or **Group Policy** to restrict PowerShell execution to admins.
- Use **Constrained Language Mode** for non-admin users.

#### 🛡️ 2. Browser + Clipboard Protections
- Use browser extensions that **disable clipboard auto-access**.
- Disable clipboard permissions for untrusted sites via browser settings or enterprise policies.

#### 🛡️ 3. Train Your Team
- Teach users: *Never paste commands from a popup or browser into the Run window.*
- Include **ClickFix-style simulations** in phishing training.

#### 🛡️ 4. Monitor and Alert
- Configure your EDR or SIEM to flag suspicious PowerShell behavior:
  - Clipboard reads + script execution  
  - `Invoke-WebRequest` or `IEX` usage  
  - Unusual use of `cmd.exe /c` from a user session

### 🧠 Pro Tip: “Helpful” Doesn’t Mean Harmless

ClickFix preys on users who just want to solve a problem. It exploits trust, speed, and muscle memory — the same instincts that make us good at our jobs.

> 💬 *“The most dangerous malware is the one you run yourself — willingly.”*

### 📋 TL;DR Summary

| Feature                | Danger                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uses clipboard hijack  | Yes — via JavaScript Clipboard API                                     |
| Requires user action   | Yes — user pastes & runs PowerShell manually                           |
| Traditional AV detects | Often no — user is executing the code themselves                      |
| Mitigation             | PowerShell restrictions, clipboard permissions, user training          |

## 🧯 Response Checklist

- ✅ Disable clipboard access in browsers via policies  
- ✅ Block PowerShell for non-admin users  
- ✅ Implement behavior-based PowerShell detection  
- ✅ Run a phishing test simulation that mimics ClickFix  
- ✅ Update awareness training immediately

---

> 🧠 Stay sharp. Stay skeptical. And never, ever paste mystery code into your system — no matter how friendly that popup looks.
