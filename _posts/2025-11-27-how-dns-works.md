The Domain Name Service, commonly referred to as DNS is the, without exagerration, the backbone of the internet. This protocol is how each user of the world wide web is able to shop on Amazon, check their bank account balance, and rage bait someone on social media from either their phone or computer. DNS is considered the phonebook of the internet, imagine yourself opening up some treeware back in the 80s or 90s, looking up a colleagues name and their phone number by scanning each page, you find their name and to the right is their phone number, this is similar to DNS. With DNS we associate a domain name (i.e. google.com) with a digital address (called an IPv4 address) of 8.8.8.8. So how does DNS do this?
