title: "How to segment your home network with PfSense, Unifi, and a Managed Switch"
description: "Learn how to segment your network with Pfsense, Unifi, and a Netgear 8-Port Managed switch. We will configure multiple VLANs for IOT, work, guest, and personal networks, including Wifi. We will use PfSEnse to create the VLANs and configure DHCP settings. With a Unifi AP we will use the Unifi Management Console to setup our different Wifi Networks. The Netgear 8-Port managed switch will be used to designate which VLAN(s) can flow through which port."
