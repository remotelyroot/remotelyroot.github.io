The Domain Name Service, commonly referred to as DNS is the, without exagerration, the backbone of the internet. This protocol is how each user of the world wide web is able to shop on Amazon, check their bank account balance, and rage bait someone on social media from either their phone or computer. DNS is considered the phonebook of the internet, imagine yourself opening up some treeware back in the 80s or 90s, looking up a colleagues name and their phone number by scanning each page, you find their name and to the right is their phone number, this is similar to DNS. With DNS we associate a domain name (i.e. google.com) with a digital address (called an IPv4 address) of 8.8.8.8. So how does DNS do this? 

### What to understand about DNS

In the beginning of time

With the rapid growth of internet from the 70s into the 80s and more and more sites were being created, a problem evolved, there became a basic need for a consistent name space which would be used for referring to resources.



Sites were accessed by typing in an Internet Protocl (IP) address to access its contents, which is different today where we type on a domain name. Imagine having to remember 98.87.170.71 for amazon.com, 157.240.241.35 for facebook.com, or 3.173.21.90 for bankofamerica.com, 

Well, DNS solves that problem translating the IP address into a domain name and this was implemented in November of 1983 where Jon Postel, Paul Mockapetris and Craig Partridge published RFC 882 (OpenNet Initiative, 2000).
