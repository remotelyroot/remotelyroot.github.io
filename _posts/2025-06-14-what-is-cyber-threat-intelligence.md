Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) isn’t just another buzzword—it’s the **backbone of proactive cybersecurity**. It transforms raw threat data into actionable insights that help organizations predict, prepare for, and prevent cyberattacks.

In this post, we’ll dive into **everything**: what CTI is, how it works, the tools behind it, career paths, real-world examples, and how you can get started.

## 🔍 What Is Cyber Threat Intelligence?

**Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** is the process of collecting, analyzing, and sharing data about potential or active cyber threats. It’s used by defenders to:

- Understand adversary behavior
- Strengthen detection and response
- Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Reduce false positives in SOC alerts
- Support strategic decisions at executive levels

CTI makes your security posture go from reactive ➜ **predictive**.

## 🌀 The Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

1. **Planning & Direction**  
   Define what threats matter—e.g., ransomware, APTs, phishing.

2. **Collection**  
   Gather logs, malware samples, darknet data, open-source intel (OSINT), threat feeds.

3. **Processing**  
   Normalize, structure, deduplicate, and enrich the collected data.

4. **Analysis**  
   Correlate data, identify patterns and actors, assess threat levels.

5. **Dissemination**  
   Share with SOCs, executives, partners, or ISACs.

6. **Feedback**  
   Use post-incident learnings to improve the cycle.
