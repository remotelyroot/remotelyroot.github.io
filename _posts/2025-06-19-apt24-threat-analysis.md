APT24 is a lesser-known but persistent **cyber espionage group**, suspected to operate out of or in service of **Middle Eastern geopolitical interests**. Though they lack the public branding of other APTs, their **surveillance-driven operations** reveal a well-resourced threat actor focused on government, telecom, finance, and foreign policy targets.

---

## üß† Who Is APT24?

APT24 is not officially confirmed by any government, but its infrastructure, malware, and targets point toward **Iran-linked or Iran-aligned** cyber capabilities. Some believe it to be a shell group or evolving subset of **APT34 (OilRig)** or **APT39**. 

APT24 campaigns often escalate during periods of **regional conflict**, particularly when Iran is under international scrutiny or cyber retaliation pressure.

---

## üß¨ Campaign Activity and Objectives

APT24 targets include:

- Government ministries
- Telecom and energy infrastructure
- Academic institutions and researchers
- NGOs and foreign diplomats
- Journalists and opposition figures

Their objectives lean heavily toward **espionage and surveillance**, with a preference for **quiet, long-term access** over destructive operations.

## üß∞ Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)

APT24‚Äôs known playbook includes:

| Phase                | TTP                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Initial Access       | Spear phishing with malicious documents |
| Execution            | PowerShell payloads via macro scripts   |
| Persistence          | Registry keys and scheduled tasks       |
| Privilege Escalation | Credential scraping with Mimikatz       |
| Lateral Movement     | Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)           |
| Exfiltration         | HTTP POST beacons and DNS tunneling     |

They also deploy **web shells** on vulnerable IIS/Apache servers and frequently use **LOLBins** like `certutil.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, and `mshta.exe`.

---

## üîç Tools Used by APT24

- **PowerLess RAT** ‚Äì Custom remote access trojan leveraging encrypted C2
- **Nerex Loader** ‚Äì Used to stage memory-resident payloads
- **Macro-based keyloggers** ‚Äì Embedded in Microsoft Office documents
- **Web shells** ‚Äì China Chopper variants, ASPX reverse shells
- **DNS tunneling frameworks** ‚Äì For stealthy data exfiltration

APT24 is also known for **retooling leaked source malware**, modifying open-source payloads to create false flags or sidestep signature detection.

---

## üåê Geopolitical Context

APT24 operations often sync with:
- **Nuclear negotiations involving Iran**
- **UN sanctions or investigations**
- **Strikes against proxy militias**
- **Internal dissent within Middle Eastern states**

Rather than headline-making ransomware, APT24 seeks **quiet leverage**, digital footholds, and **strategic reconnaissance**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Measures

To defend against APT24-style threats:

- üîê Enforce **macro restrictions** across Microsoft Office
- üîç Log and monitor **PowerShell execution** with AMSI
- üöß Harden perimeter-facing web servers and restrict uploads
- üß† Monitor for abnormal outbound DNS queries
- üîë Segment networks to limit lateral access
- ‚ö† Set up **SIEM alerts** for known LOLBin usage patterns

APT24 thrives in environments with **weak user awareness** and **exposed IT services**.

## üìö Related Threats

| APT Group               | Known For                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| APT34                   | Credential theft, supply chain compromise      |
| APT39                   | Mobile device surveillance and travel tracking |
| Charming Kitten (APT35) | Phishing & social engineering campaigns        |

APT24 may operate **independently or in coordination** with these threat groups.

## üß≠ Final Thoughts

APT24 reminds us that some of the most dangerous actors don‚Äôt make the headlines‚Äîthey operate **in silence**, aiming for **strategic access**, not chaos.

Organizations must treat espionage-grade threats as **ever-present risks**, particularly in regions entangled in **geopolitical friction**.

**Monitor. Detect. Adapt. And never underestimate the quiet ones.**
